# Introduction

With the introduction of the [new drivers for Datastax/Cassandra](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/4.13/manual/core/) comes a problem for testing. The drivers utilise a DAO defined via an interface which then generates source code via Maven compilation.

Testing this meaningfully as it is autogenerated requires an integration testing approach.
# TL;DR

Cassandra unit is straightforward to use and implement but has many outdated dependancies. Simulacrum  didnâ€™t work with the 4.x series drivers. Additionally, it is built (IMO) for lower level FMEA tasks and as such is complex and far more involved.

# This project

A simple web service was developed using the spring boot starter and the most basic implementation of the Datastax DAO Mapper. *Note: The project structure only exists to serve as a skeleton supporting the creation of tests (and to facilitate learning some Spring basics).*

# Run

From the project root run: `mvn compile package test`
